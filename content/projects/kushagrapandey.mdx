## About this project

**You’re on it.** This site is my TypeScript + Next.js portfolio with MDX content, Tailwind styling, and Contentlayer for type-safe content. Deployed on **Vercel** with edge caching + incremental revalidation.

### Why this build?
- **Fast, minimal UI** with subtle motion.
- **MDX-first authoring**: add a file → it’s live.
- **Type safety** end-to-end via Contentlayer.

## Core stack

- **Next.js (App Router):** `app/projects/[slug]` for detail, `app/projects/page.tsx` for the grid.
- **TypeScript:** strict types for content + components.
- **Tailwind CSS:** utility styling; `@tailwindcss/typography` for MDX.
- **Contentlayer:** compiles MDX, generates `allProjects` + computed `slug`.
- **Vercel:** CDN, fast builds, `revalidate` for fresh lists.
